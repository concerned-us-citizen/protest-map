Critical:
- Verify counts against K's numbers

Moderate:

- Using synchronous results on autocomplete before opening may end up feeling unresponsive
- better aria/keyboard handling
- scroll map to show full tooltip
- timeline selection bar disappears when selecting from date picker
- timeline can overlap map zoom controls
- Timeline highlighted date bars extend beyond top of selection
- Slide transition for filter
- Scroll map popups into view
- Transitions for map markers
- Fold multiple events into one in popup
- date picker header button colors should match ours (would require layout css tweaks as well as background color)

Back Burner:
- switch to using undefined everywhere
- move geocoding to the other project
- Visible region filtering
