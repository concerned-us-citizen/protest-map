Critical:
- Verify counts against K's numbers
- Bad geocodings on 6/14 turnouts

Moderate:

- Add event names to search, on select they should set the event name filter
- Fold multiple events into one in popup
- Scroll map popups into view
- Track and add event time to popups
- Using synchronous results on autocomplete before opening may end up feeling unresponsive
- better aria/keyboard handling
- timeline selection bar disappears when selecting from date picker
- timeline can overlap map zoom controls
- Timeline highlighted date bars extend beyond top of selection
- Slide transition for filter
- Transitions for map markers
- date picker header button colors should match ours (would require layout css tweaks as well as background color)

Back Burner:
- switch to using undefined everywhere
- move geocoding to the other project
- Visible region filtering
