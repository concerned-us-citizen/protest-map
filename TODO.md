Next:
Autocomplete shows non pretty name in pill (suggestions have pretty names, but id'd regions don't)
startup looks janky - should show initial state first
z-order of dim layer is wrong - buttons and timeline showing through
Using synchronous results on autocomplete before opening feels unresponsive
Fix width of drawer
Alignment of buttons on appbar
Alignment of top of all dropdowns
On mobile, clear text field to show recents, then try scrolling. Entire screen scrolls.
Font size on filter descriptors?
Arrow key advance is skipping an extra sometimes
Look for references to labels that say Protests, add a func to show that or Protesters.
Showing numbers > 1 in turnout mode - more than one at a location? Need to group them
The main screen scrolls on the phone when in landscape and the drawer is opened
Size adjusted radius of count marker, with correct counts
Count specific popup
Visible region filtering

Severe:
- Update help
- better aria/keyboard handling

Moderate:
- Worcester, MA showing up in upper Michigan? 7/4
- seeing clusters of two that can't be expanded
- Undo zoom sometimes fails
- scroll map to show full tooltip
- investigate vitest failure
- layout of timeline sometimes not wide enough

Back Burner:
- switch to using undefined everywhere
- refactor map to have its different layers in a separate files
- move geocoding to the other project
