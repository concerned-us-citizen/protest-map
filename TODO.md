Critical:
- Verify counts against K's numbers


Moderate:
- Try out scrape of event sites
- Set map margin based on what controls are visible
- Keep event info panel open during animation
- Add event names to search, on select they should switch to an event name page
- Show time and organizer in popup
- Using synchronous results on autocomplete before opening may end up feeling unresponsive
- better aria/keyboard handling
- timeline selection bar disappears when selecting from date picker
- Transitions for map markers

Back Burner:
- switch to using undefined everywhere
- move geocoding to the other project
- Visible region filtering
- date picker header button colors should match ours (would require layout css tweaks as well as background color, also sveltypicker is a web component)
- timeline can overlap map zoom controls
