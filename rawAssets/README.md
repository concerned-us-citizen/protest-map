The Illustrator file contains the presentation of the different elements of the markers.
The sprite-svg files were exported from the Illustrator file. They are each expected to have a square viewbox of 40px.
The sprite files, placed in static/sprites, were generated by the sprite-svg files, using spreet:

$ brew install flother/taps/spreet
$ spreet --sdf --retina rawAssets/sprite-svg static/sprites/sprite@2x
$ spreet --sdf rawAssets/sprite-svg static/sprites/sprite
