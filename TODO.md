Critical:
- Verify counts against K's numbers
Wisconsin 6/15 shows 1 location, but no markers
Arkansas 6/2 shows 2

Moderate:
When animating, event info should stay up entire time, it makes it blinky as it dismisses while animating
Try out scrape of event sites
Set map margin based on what controls are visible

- Keep event info panel open during animation
- Add event names to search, on select they should switch to an event name page
- Fold multiple events into one in popup
- Show time and organizer in popup
- Using synchronous results on autocomplete before opening may end up feeling unresponsive
- better aria/keyboard handling
- timeline selection bar disappears when selecting from date picker
- timeline can overlap map zoom controls
- Timeline highlighted date bars extend beyond top of selection
- Slide transition for filter
- Transitions for map markers
- date picker header button colors should match ours (would require layout css tweaks as well as background color, also sveltypicker is a web component)

Back Burner:
- switch to using undefined everywhere
- move geocoding to the other project
- Visible region filtering
